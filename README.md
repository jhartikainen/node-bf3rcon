This was used in a BF3 admin tool web app. Possibly sort of bad in places.

Connection object handles the actual BF3 server connection low level stuff.

Server is a higher level abstraction of a single BF3 server on top of a Connection.

Implementation may be out of date to a degree to actual BF3 RCON protocol (not updated since Back to Karkand)
